# CheckHJT
Checks HJT logs and outputs issues. This script is designed for SuperBot with some support for CLI, I know outputting to a HTML file all the time is inefficient.
I do not currently plan on making this file optimised or overhauling it
This script will not be updated as often as the one the bot has.
